# Predicting University Graduation Rates: A Multiple Linear Regression Case Study

## Description

How can universities improve their graduation rates? In this project, I act as a data science consultant to identify the key predictors of student success using a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) framework.

The Objective? 
Construct a predictive model for College Graduation Rate using quantitative university data.

## Workflow

The project was broken down in the following stages:

1) Project Scope: Understanding the problem statement, requirements, and technical stack for the development of a project workflow

2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing associations through scatter plots

3) Model Development: Building a 3-predictor regression model and interpreting coefficients to understand the impact of specific variables

4) Statistical Validation: Validating important assumptions for linear modeling

5) Findings & Recommendations: Presenting important model findings and addressing whether the model is useful in practice for prediction with data-backed recommendations to university leadership
